    <p>Charles Babbage was an English mathematician and inventor who is credited with having conceived the first automatic digital computer.</p>
    <br>
<p>On December 26 1791, Charles Babbage was born in London, England and passed on October 18 1871. He was raised by his parents Benjamin Babbage, who died in 1827 and Betsy Plumleigh Babbage, who died in 1844. Babbage also grew up with his two siblings named Mary Ann and Henry Babbage.</p> 
    <br>
<p>As a child Babbage always had a curious mind. When he would get a new toy he would try to figure out how they functioned by taking them apart. Babbage also found an interest in mathematics at a young age and taught himself algebra.</p> 
    <br>
<p>In 1810, Babbage entered Trinity college at Cambridge university and figured out that he understood mathematics more than his instructors. He helped found the Analytical Society, which played a key role in reducing the uncritical following of Sir Issac Newton.</p> 
    <br>
<p>In 1814, Babbage graduated from Cambridge Trinity collage and also married Georgiana Whitmore. They had eight children together, but only three lived beyond childhood. Georgiana herself died in 1827.</p> 
    <br>
<p>Babbage produced the first model of the calculation engine which calculated and printed mathematical tables in 1822. He called his invention the "difference engine" after the mathematical theory that the machine's operation was based on. The Difference Engine was a digital device that operated on discrete digits rather than smooth quantities. The digits were decimal represented by positions on toothed wheels rather than bits. The construction of this device required the development of mechanical engineering techniques, which Babbage devoted himself to. However, the full engine was never built. All design and construction ceased in 1833, when Joseph Clement, the machinist responsible for building the machine, refused to continue unless he was prepaid.</p> 
    <br>
<p>During the mid 30s Babbage developed plans for the Analytical Engine. In that device he envisioned the capability of performing arithmetical operations on the basis of instructions from a memory unit. Same as with the Difference Engine, the project was far more complex than anything built at that time. The memory unit was planned to be large enough to hold 1,000 50-digit numbers; this was larger than the storage capacity of any computer built before 1960. The Analytical Engine, however, was never completed. Babbage’s design was forgotten until his unpublished notebooks were discovered in 1937. In 1991 British scientists built Difference Engine No. 2 to Babbage’s specifications, and in 2000 the printer for the Difference Engine was also built.</p>

<p>Charles Babbage is considered the “father of the computer”, Babbage is credited with inventing the first mechanical computer that eventually led to more complex designs.</p>
    <br>
<p>As a student, Babbage was also a member of other societies such as The Ghost Club, concerned with investigating supernatural phenomena,</p> 
    <br>
<p>He lectured to the Royal Institution on astronomy in 1815, and was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society in 1816.</p> 
    <br>
<p>As a child, Babbage struggled with an illness. At the age of 8, he was sent to a country school, so he could recover from a life-threatening fever. After this, he was sent back to school but was later educated by private tutors because Charles continued to struggle with illness.</p> 
    <br>
<p>In order to graduate, Charles had to write a thesis. While he completed his thesis, the college felt that the thesis was blasphemous, and they refused to sign Charles’ diploma after he had completed such a thesis.</p>
